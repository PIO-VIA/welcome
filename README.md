# ENSPY Welcome Page by Club GI

## About This Project

This is a simple, single-file, dynamic welcome page created by the **Club Génie Informatique (Computer Engineering Club)** to congratulate and welcome new students who have successfully passed the entrance examination for the National Advanced School of Engineering of Yaounde (ENSPY).

The goal is to provide a warm, visually appealing, and celebratory greeting to the newcomers as they begin their academic journey.

## Features

- **All-in-One File:** The entire page—HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript animations—is contained within a single `index.html` file for simplicity and portability.
- **Dynamic Fireworks:** A continuous, randomly generated fireworks display in the background, created using the HTML Canvas API.
- **Animated Logos:** The logos of the "Club GI" and its partner "Hello World" float gently at the top of the welcome message.
- **Custom Welcome Message:** A warm and encouraging message for the new students.
- **Social Media Links:** A collection of icons linking to the club's various social media profiles (Facebook, WhatsApp, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, X, LinkedIn).
- **Link to Main Website:** A clear call-to-action button that directs visitors to the club's official website.
- **ENSPY Branding:** The official ENSPY logo is subtly displayed as the page background.

## How to Use

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the page and its animations. No web server or setup is required.
